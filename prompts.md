# Project Development Overview

## Development Approach

This project was developed through iterative collaboration with an AI assistant, utilizing conversational prompting rather than predefined specifications. The development process involved continuous refinement and enhancement of the codebase through interactive dialogue.

## Architecture Evolution

The system architecture underwent a significant transformation:
- **Initial State**: Monolithic repository with a V1 implementation supporting only 3 fixed warehouses
- **Current State**: Scalable N-warehouse solution with modular architecture and comprehensive API support

## Documentation Structure

The project documentation is organized into two primary directories:

### 1. AI Migration Documentation (`ai-migration-docs/`)
Contains comprehensive technical documentation of the migration process, including:
- Architectural decisions and rationale
- Implementation details and methodologies
- Migration strategies and best practices
- Technical specifications generated through AI collaboration

### 2. AI Interaction Logs (`ai-interactions/`)
Preserves key interactions with the AI assistant that led to significant code enhancements, including:
- Problem-solving sessions and their outcomes
- Code refactoring discussions and implementations
- Bug identification and resolution processes
- Feature development conversations

Each document in these directories represents a collaborative session that contributed to the evolution and improvement of the codebase.
