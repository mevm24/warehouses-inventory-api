# Conversation Context - Resume Point

## Session Info
- **Date**: September 25, 2025
- **Project**: Warehouse Inventory Management API
- **Working Directory**: `C:\Users\Marco\Desktop\warehouses-test`

## What We Discussed

### 1. Initial Question
You asked: "Can you check the project I'm currently on?"

### 2. Requirements Review
You provided detailed requirements for an ecommerce API that manages inventory across multiple warehouses (A, B, C) with transfer capabilities.

### 3. Analysis Performed
- ✅ Reviewed project structure
- ✅ Analyzed current implementation
- ✅ Checked all required endpoints
- ✅ Verified warehouse integrations
- ✅ Examined transfer business rules
- ✅ Reviewed authentication and error handling

### 4. Versioning Discussion
You asked: "You helped me with the versioning, how can it be improved?"

I found:
- V1 is currently active at `/api/v1/inventory`
- V2 code exists but isn't mounted (has better features)
- No version negotiation or deprecation strategy
- V2 includes dynamic warehouse management

### 5. Key Findings

**Working Features:**
- Basic inventory queries (combined UPC/category endpoint)
- Transfer functionality with fastest/cheapest rules
- Mock integrations for warehouses A, B, C
- Basic authentication
- Swagger documentation

**Issues Found:**
- V2 routes not activated despite being coded
- Endpoints combined instead of separate (category vs UPC)
- Distance calculations not used in main transfer logic
- Inventory quantities not updated during transfers
- No version negotiation middleware

## To Resume Work

### Quick Status Check Commands:
```bash
# Check if server is running
npm start

# Run tests to verify current state
npm test

# Check test coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Activate V2 routes** in `src/index.ts`:
```typescript
import inventoryRoutesV2 from './controllers/inventoryV2';
app.use('/api/v2/inventory', inventoryRoutesV2);
```

2. **Test V2 endpoints** (after activation):
- GET /api/v2/inventory/warehouses
- POST /api/v2/inventory/transfer (with auto-source selection)

3. **Implement version negotiation** (see API_ANALYSIS_SESSION.md for details)

### Context for Questions:
- "We were working on improving the API versioning"
- "V2 is already coded but not active"
- "The main issues are endpoint separation and distance calculations"
