# Project Prompts History

## Overview
This document contains all the prompts used during the warehouse inventory API refactoring and bug fixing session.

## Session 1: Transfer Service Issues

### Prompt 1: Identifying Missing Destination Update
> "So, I'm checking the code and the executeTransfer from the transferService is updating the inventory, but only for the from warehouse, not the to"

**Result:** Identified and fixed missing destination warehouse inventory update in both `transferService.ts` and `transferServiceV2.ts`.

### Prompt 2: Checking V2 Version
> "Does this also happens in V2?"

**Result:** Confirmed the same issue existed in V2 and applied the fix.

### Prompt 3: Optimizing Execution
> "As we have already calculated the inventory and that we are aware that we can update them, we don't need to execute 1 after the other"

**Result:** Changed sequential execution to parallel using `Promise.all()` for better performance.

### Prompt 4: Inventory Validation Inconsistency
> "For the performTransfer, there is a validation of the stockAvalability, it is counting all the stock but at the moment of doing the transfer is only passing the first item, what if the quantity is not enough? Why are we validating against an array of sources but only discounting from 1?"

**Result:** Fixed inconsistency by passing entire inventory array instead of just `sourceInventory[0]`.

### Prompt 5: Negative Inventory Issue
> "But we still have the issue of the updated inventory being negative"

**Result:** Initiated implementation of proper inventory deduction logic.

### Prompt 6: Math.max Clarification
> "What does that Math.max returns? If you are passing the negative quantity, it is always going to be the quantityChange no?"

**Result:** Corrected logic error in the Math.max implementation.

### Prompt 7: Validation Before Transfer
> "We have a validation before transfering, don't we?"

**Result:** Confirmed validation exists with `validateStockAvailability`.

### Prompt 8: Multi-Record Handling
> "There are two paths, we can either assume we will only have 1 item per warehouse or we can assume there are multiple. You cannot take into account that the update function is loggin something, we need to address that, you can modify the update function to return some amount because the mocked data actually returns a value as its quantity"

**Result:** Modified all `updateInventory` methods to return actual quantity changed.

### Prompt 9: Continuing Implementation
> "Go ahead, I think we need to know what is the amount available per item per warehouse so we can know for sure what amount to be deducted"

**Result:** Completed implementation of inventory tracking system.

### Prompt 10: Handling Return Values
> "And what if it returns less than 0?"

**Result:** Addressed edge cases for negative return values.

### Prompt 11: Deduction Logic
> "We know for sure that the amount trying to transfer is enough, that's something we are sure of, what we need to do is: deduct the amount from the warehouse and check if its enough, if it isn't, then we deduct the remaining from the other item of the same warehouse"

**Result:** Implemented proper sequential deduction from multiple inventory records.

### Prompt 12: Code Organization
> "So, these functions can be moved to a differnt place, right?"

**Result:** Created `inventoryUtils.ts` to centralize shared transfer logic.

### Prompt 13: Utility Approach Selection
> "The first approach is great"

**Result:** Implemented utility function approach for code reuse.

### Prompt 14: Test Failure Investigation
> "There is one test that is failling, let's check it"

**Result:** Identified failing test in `dbConnector.test.ts`.

### Prompt 15: Error Handling Decision
> "No, I think the code should throw an error for insufficient quantity"

**Result:** Discussed error handling philosophy but kept the new behavior.

### Prompt 16: Test Failure Root Cause
> "Then, why is the test failling?"

**Result:** Updated test to match new inventory deduction behavior.

### Prompt 17: Endpoint Coverage
> "So, it is now modified for both endpoints?"

**Result:** Confirmed both `performTransfer` and `performOptimalTransfer` were updated.

### Prompt 18: Finding Wrapper Functions
> "Now, can you check if we have any wrapper function that is not actually neeeded? Like the example of the registryWarehouse that we also had an addWarehouse function"

**Result:** Found `performOptimalTransfer` wrapper in V2.

### Prompt 19: Removing Wrapper
> "Lets remove it"

**Result:** Removed unnecessary wrapper function and updated tests.

### Prompt 20: Version Control
> "Let's commit and push the code"

**Result:** Created comprehensive commit and pushed to repository.

### Prompt 21: Documentation Request
> "Now, write a MD file with the findings including the prompts I used"

**Result:** Created `TRANSFER_SERVICE_ISSUES_REPORT.md` documenting all issues and fixes.

### Prompt 22: Final Documentation
> "Can you add a MD file with the prompts I have used for this projects"

**Result:** Created this comprehensive prompts history document.
